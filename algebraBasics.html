<h1>Square Roots</h1>
   A radical, √, signifies we are taking the principal square root of a number,
   which means we always will get a positive number as an answer.

   EXAMPLE 1:

   √9 = 3
   -√9 = -3 

   But x^2 = 9 ; x can be + or - 3

   ELIMINATING RADICALS USING EXPONENTS
   Radicals can be eliminated from equations using the exponent version of the index number. 
   For example, in the equation √x = 4, the radical is canceled out by raising both sides to 
   the second power: (√x)^2 = (4)^2 or x = 16.

   The inverse exponent of the index number is equivalent to the radical itself. 
   For example, √9 is the same as 9^1/2. Writing the radical in this manner may
   come in handy when working with an equation that has a large number of exponents.
